workflow of scheduler

Allocator service handles the scheduling and allocating tasks

Tables:
sched_stage
sched_queue
sched_wait
sched_ready
sched_exec

1. Check database periodically and poll the runnable jobs into sched_stage
2. For each job in sched_stage
2a. If job is callable, push the job into sched_queue
2b. If job is bundle, push all of its callable jobs into sched_queue
3. For each job in sched_queue, check start condition
3a. If satisfied, push the job into sched_ready then remove from sched_queue
3b. Otherwise, push the job into sched_wait then remove from sched_queue
4. Controller.Executor pulls the job from sched_ready and execute its command on mentioned machine
5. Controller.Executor removes the job from sched_ready and push into sched_exec
6. Controller.Heartbeat checks if each running jobs are alive
7. If job execution is completed, Controller will request Allocator.Workflow to check if any child job waiting in sched_wait
7a. Child job in sched_wait will be removed from sched_wait then pushed into sched_ready
8. If executed job has parent, check status of all child jobs of that parent
8a. If any child jobs are running/waiting then parent waits for them to complete
8b. Otherwise update the status of parent job then remove it from sched_stage
